## BOT BATTLR CODE CHALLENGE
Bot Battle is a web application that allows users to assemble their armies of robots, engage in battles, and manage their robot collection. This project is designed to demonstrate basic React functionality, data fetching, and user interaction.



## Features
1. Bot Collection: View a collection of available robots, each with their own attributes, including health, damage, armor, and more.

2. Add to Army: Add robots from the collection to your bot army. Once a robot is added, it will be displayed in your army.

3. Remove from Army: Remove robots from your bot army and place them back into the collection.

4. Sort Robots: Sort the available robots in the collection based on different criteria, such as health, damage, and armor.

5. Battle: Engage your robot army in epic battles with other robot armies and see who emerges victorious.

## Technologies Used
1. React: The front-end of the application is built using React, which allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

2. CSS: Custom CSS is used for styling, providing an appealing and consistent look to the application.

3. REST API: The application fetches robot data from a RESTful API, allowing real-time updates and interactions
